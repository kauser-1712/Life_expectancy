# **Investigating Life Expectancy**
This project is all about figuring out why some people live longer than others. By looking at things like healthcare, money, lifestyle, and where they live, we can learn what makes a big difference in how long someone lives. This helps governments and doctors make better decisions about how to keep people healthy. It can also help you make choices that might help you live longer.

So, in a nutshell, this project is about finding out what makes people live longer and using that knowledge to make our lives healthier and better.
